PlasticBox
==========

A better version of EA's GlassBox engine.

Yes, it's text-based, BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS. Or at least closer to it.

PlasticBox is under Fork and Pull. If you want to contribute to PlasticBox, fork the project, make your changes, and then send a pull request. I will look at the fork, request any changes that are necessary, and decide on whether or not to merge.
